  + "In its canonical textual representation, the 16 octets of a UUID are represented as 32 hexadecimal (base-16) digits, displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens)"
  + Format: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    * "The 4 bits of digit M indicate the UUID version, and the 1â€“3 most significant bits of digit N indicate the UUID variant"
  + Example: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
    * "In the example, M is 1, and N is a (10xx2), meaning that the UUID is a variant-1, version-1 UUID; that is, a time-based DCE/RFC 4122 UUID."
