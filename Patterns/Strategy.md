C# Strategy Pattern Resources
====
aka Policy Pattern 


### Notes:
* The Strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
* Strategy Pattern is a behavioral software design pattern, which enables choosing of an algorithm at the runtime.
* Strategy pattern allows us to vary the algorithm independently from clients that use it
* Strategy is a behavioral pattern while Factory is a creational pattern

    * "Here are some criticisms of the Enum approach to the Strategy Pattern:"
      * "One of the strengths of the classic implementation is that you donâ€™t have any merge issues when you implement a new strategy since the strategy implementations are in separate classes."
      * "You would have to know all possible strategies at compile time, and you are not able to add new strategies at runtime."
      * "It violates the rule of 'open for extension but closed for modification'."
      * "Main applicable use would be when you need a limited amount of strategies and limited to those."
